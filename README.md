An application to control snom 3xx phones from the desktop.

## State: alpha

Currently only dialing numbers is implemented. If needed, more features will be added.


## Documentation

The programm is currently so small that a documentation isn't necessary. If
stuff should be unclear hover over the input fields to get a tooltip.

But be aware that: *use hidden tags* must be set to *off* on the phone. See
[http://wiki.snom.com/Settings/use_hidden_tags]()
